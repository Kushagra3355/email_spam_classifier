## Requirements

```
numpy
pandas
nltk
scikit-learn
streamlit
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn
wordcloud
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kushagra3355/email_spam_classifier.git
cd email_spam_classifier
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Dataset

The project uses the SMS dataset located in the `data/` folder which contains:

- SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'
- Preprocessed and cleaned for training

## Model Training

The complete model training process is available in [model.ipynb](model.ipynb):

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove unnecessary columns
   - Label encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Statistical analysis
   - Visualization of spam vs ham distribution
   - Word cloud generation
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Character count
   - Word count
   - Sentence count

4. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Custom `transform_text()` function
   - TF-IDF vectorization

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Multiple algorithms tested
   - Accuracy and precision metrics
   - Model comparison and selection

## Usage

### Running the Web Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Classifier

1. Enter your email or SMS message in the text area
2. Click the "Predict" button
3. Get instant classification: **Spam** or **Not Spam**

## Model Performance

The final model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages. Detailed performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are available in the notebook.

## Technical Details

- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Preprocessing**: NLTK for tokenization and stemming
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle for saving trained model and vectorizer
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit for interactive UI
